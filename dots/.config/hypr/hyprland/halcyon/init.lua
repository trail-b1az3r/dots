-- Halcyon: this repository's layer on top of end-4's illogical-impulse.
--
-- Everything Halcyon changes about Hyprland lives in this folder, loaded
-- after the upstream defaults and before ~/.config/hypr/custom, so:
--   * upstream files stay untouched and upstream fixes merge cleanly;
--   * your own custom/*.lua still wins over anything set here.
--
-- To drop a part of the layer, comment out its line below.
